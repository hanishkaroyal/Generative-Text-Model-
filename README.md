DESCRIPTION: Text Generation with GPT
This project demonstrates how to use a pre-trained GPT model from Hugging Face's Transformers library to generate coherent paragraphs of text based on user prompts. The notebook is designed to guide users through loading a GPT model, defining a text generation function, and generating text on various topics.

Features
Pre-trained GPT Model: Utilizes OpenAI's GPT-2, a powerful language model capable of generating human-like text.
Customizable Parameters: Adjust text generation parameters such as:
max_length: Limit the length of the generated text.
temperature: Control randomness in text generation.
top_k: Enable top-k sampling for more focused outputs.
Easy-to-Use Interface: The notebook is structured for beginners and experienced users alike, providing clear instructions and examples.
Project Highlights
Libraries Used:

transformers: For model and tokenizer loading.
torch: For tensor operations and model execution.
Core Functionality:

Encode user prompts into input tokens.
Generate text using the GPT model with configurable parameters.
Decode and display the generated text.
Interactive Example:

Input prompt: "Artificial intelligence is transforming the world by"
Output: A continuation of the input prompt in a coherent paragraph.
Requirements
Python 3.8 or later
Libraries:
transformers
torch
Usage
Install Dependencies:

pip install transformers torch
Run the Notebook:

Open Text_Generation_with_GPT.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
Follow the instructions to load the model and generate text.
Customize Text Generation:

Modify the input prompt and parameters in the generate_text function to explore different outputs.
Example Output
Prompt:
"The future of technology lies in"

Generated Text:
"The future of technology lies in the seamless integration of artificial intelligence, robotics, and advanced data analytics to revolutionize industries, improve lives, and drive global progress."
